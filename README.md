# Fast-and-Accurate-Least-Mean-Squares-Solvers
## Original Author's Description
Implementation of the algorithms presented in the paper "Fast and Accurate Least-Mean-Squares Solvers".  

Please cite our paper when using the code: "Fast and Accurate Least-Mean-Squares Solvers" (NIPS19' - Oral presentation) by   
Alaa Maalouf and Ibrahim Jubran and Dan Feldman.  

Example runs and documentation are available in the file Booster.py.  

Tested with Python 3.5
